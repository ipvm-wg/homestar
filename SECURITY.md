## Report a security issue or vulnerability

The [Fission][fission] team welcomes security reports and is committed to
providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be
reported privately via [support@fission.codes][support-email]. Security issues
should not be reported via the public GitHub Issue tracker.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure
process. The Fission team announces security advisories through our
Github respository's [security portal][sec-advisories] and and the
[RustSec advisory database][rustsec-db].
